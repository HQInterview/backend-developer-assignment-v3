# Backend developer assignment

Develop a simple script that retrivies file from a URL and imports data into database. Database consists of two tables: `order` and `product`. Make sure that product exists in database before creating order otherwise create new one. 

NOTE: Ensure the process can handle files of varying sizes without having to scale vertically.

**File structure**
1 order per line

```
order_code,client_name,product_code,quantity
cks12,alex-co,table,4
```

Please feel free to ask questions!

## Areas we would be evaluating
* documentation
* code style
* project structure (file/folder organization)
* architecture (components, areas of responsibility)
* complexity (easier to understand code is better)
* approach in testing
